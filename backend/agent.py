#     career-page feeds in one combined, deduplicated, relevance-ranked list
#     — you don't need to ask the user which source to use.

#     Call this whenever the user asks to see, find, or check jobs/openings —
#     e.g. "show me jobs", "find backend developer roles", "give me 3 jobs
#     related to SDE", "anything new in the last 2 days", or "find jobs I'm
#     actually qualified for" (that last phrasing needs no role at all — see
#     below). The user's saved Job Search preferences (role, location,
#     country, day range, salary floor, job type, excluded keywords) are
#     applied automatically — you do NOT need to ask the user for these
#     before calling the tool. Only pass `role`, `location`, or

#     different role, place, or day range than what they'd normally have
#     saved; otherwise leave them as None and the saved preferences are used

#     If the user has uploaded a resume (Settings -> Job Search -> Resume)
#     and hasn't set a role/preference, one of their resume's best-fit roles
#     is used automatically. Either way, every result is scored 0-100 for
#     relevance against the user's search and their resume (skills,
#     experience, location, salary, freshness) and sorted best-match-first —
#     this ranking happens for every search, not just resume-based ones.

#     IMPORTANT — count: if the user's message asks for a specific number of
#     jobs (e.g. "give me 3 jobs", "show me 5 openings", "just 1 is fine"),
#     you MUST pass that exact number as `count`. If they didn't mention a
#     number, leave `count` as None and their saved default is used.

#     The listings themselves (including each one's relevance score) are
#     already shown to the user as cards in the UI — do not re-list,
#     re-describe, or repeat any job's title, company, or description back
#     in your reply, since the full data isn't even visible to you. Just
#     give a short one-line summary (how many were found, for what, and the

# After sending, briefly confirm what you sent and to whom. If the tool
# reports that email isn't connected, tell the user to add their email in

# check jobs/openings, call it directly — their saved Job Search preferences
# are applied automatically, so don't ask them to repeat their role or
# location first unless the tool tells you none is saved. If the user's
# message names a specific number of jobs (e.g. "3 jobs", "just 2"), always
# pass that number as the tool's `count` argument. If the user asks something
# like "find jobs I'm actually qualified for" or "what jobs fit my
# background" without naming a role, still call the tool with no `role` —
# if they've uploaded a resume, it infers one automatically. Every result is
# already ranked by a relevance score (skills, experience, location, salary,

# news, prices, recent events, or anything you can't confidently answer

#     Pulls from Adzuna, RemoteOK, Remotive, and any configured company
#     career-page feeds in one combined, deduplicated, relevance-ranked list
#     — you don't need to ask the user which source to use.

#     Call this whenever the user asks to see, find, or check jobs/openings —
#     e.g. "show me jobs", "find backend developer roles", "give me 3 jobs
#     related to SDE", "anything new in the last 2 days", or "find jobs I'm
#     actually qualified for" (that last phrasing needs no role at all — see
#     below). The user's saved Job Search preferences (role, location,
#     country, day range, salary floor, job type, excluded keywords) are
#     applied automatically — you do NOT need to ask the user for these
#     before calling the tool. Only pass `role`, `location`, or
#     `max_days_old` yourself if the user's message explicitly names a
#     different role, place, or day range than what they'd normally have
#     saved; otherwise leave them as None and the saved preferences are used
#     as-is.

#     If the user has uploaded a resume (Settings -> Job Search -> Resume)
#     and hasn't set a role/preference, one of their resume's best-fit roles
#     is used automatically. Either way, every result is scored 0-100 for
#     relevance against the user's search and their resume (skills,
#     experience, location, salary, freshness) and sorted best-match-first —
#     this ranking happens for every search, not just resume-based ones.

#     IMPORTANT — count: if the user's message asks for a specific number of
#     jobs (e.g. "give me 3 jobs", "show me 5 openings", "just 1 is fine"),
#     you MUST pass that exact number as `count`. If they didn't mention a
#     number, leave `count` as None and their saved default is used.

#     The listings themselves (including each one's relevance score) are
#     already shown to the user as cards in the UI — do not re-list,
#     re-describe, or repeat any job's title, company, or description back
#     in your reply, since the full data isn't even visible to you. Just
#     give a short one-line summary (how many were found, for what, and the
#     top match's score if you were told one), and only answer a follow-up
#     question about a specific listing if the user asks one directly.

    Pulls from Adzuna, RemoteOK, Remotive, and any configured company
    career-page feeds in one combined, deduplicated, relevance-ranked list
    — you don't need to ask the user which source to use.

    Call this whenever the user asks to see, find, or check jobs/openings —
    e.g. "show me jobs", "find backend developer roles", "give me 3 jobs
    related to SDE", "anything new in the last 2 days", or "find jobs I'm
    actually qualified for" (that last phrasing needs no role at all — see
    below). The user's saved Job Search preferences (role, location,
    country, day range, salary floor, job type, excluded keywords) are
    applied automatically — you do NOT need to ask the user for these
    before calling the tool. Only pass `role`, `location`, or
    `max_days_old` yourself if the user's message explicitly names a
    different role, place, or day range than what they'd normally have
    saved; otherwise leave them as None and the saved preferences are used
    as-is.

    If the user has uploaded a resume (Settings -> Job Search -> Resume)
    and hasn't set a role/preference, one of their resume's best-fit roles
    is used automatically. Either way, every result is scored 0-100 for
    relevance against the user's search and their resume (skills,
    experience, location, salary, freshness) and sorted best-match-first —
    this ranking happens for every search, not just resume-based ones.

    IMPORTANT — count: if the user's message asks for a specific number of
    jobs (e.g. "give me 3 jobs", "show me 5 openings", "just 1 is fine"),
    you MUST pass that exact number as `count`. If they didn't mention a
    number, leave `count` as None and their saved default is used.

    The listings themselves (including each one's relevance score) are
    already shown to the user as cards in the UI — do not re-list,
    re-describe, or repeat any job's title, company, or description back
    in your reply, since the full data isn't even visible to you. Just
    give a short one-line summary (how many were found, for what, and the
    top match's score if you were told one), and only answer a follow-up
    question about a specific listing if the user asks one directly.

    Args:
        role: Optional override for the job title/keywords to search.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful AI assistant with access to tools. Answer clearly, concisely, and honestly.
If you are not sure about something, say so instead of guessing.

You have a search_jobs tool. When the user asks to see, find, or
check jobs/openings, call it directly — their saved Job Search preferences
are applied automatically, so don't ask them to repeat their role or
location first unless the tool tells you none is saved. If the user's
message names a specific number of jobs (e.g. "3 jobs", "just 2"), always
pass that number as the tool's `count` argument. If the user asks something
like "find jobs I'm actually qualified for" or "what jobs fit my
background" without naming a role, still call the tool with no `role` —
if they've uploaded a resume, it infers one automatically. Every result is
already ranked by a relevance score (skills, experience, location, salary,
and freshness against their search and resume) before it reaches you. The
job listings themselves are rendered to the user separately as cards, and
you are not given their contents back — keep your reply to a short
one-line summary (mentioning the top match's score if the tool told you
one) rather than listing or describing the jobs yourself.

You also have a web_search tool for current, real-world information —
news, prices, recent events, or anything you can't confidently answer
from memory. Call it when the user's question depends on up-to-date
information, then answer using what it returns. Briefly mention that you
searched the web when you use it, and don't fabricate sources or figures
if the tool comes back empty — just say so.
